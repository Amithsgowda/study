Setting up the environment in Java

Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented etc.
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer
architecture.The latest version is Java 8.

There are few things which must be clear before setting up the environment

    1.JDK(Java Development Kit) : JDK is intended for software developers and includes development tools such 
    as the Java compiler, Javadoc, Jar, and a debugger.
    2.JRE(Java Runtime Environment) : JRE contains the parts of the Java libraries required to run Java programs
    and is intended for end users. JRE can be view as a subset of JDK.
    3.JVM: JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment 
    in which java bytecode can be executed. JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. 
 
 System is a class in the java.lang package.
 out is a static member of the System class, and is an instance of java.io.PrintStream.
 println is a method of java.io.PrintStream . This method is overloaded to print message to output destination, 
 which is typically a console or file.
